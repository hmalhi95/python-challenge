Step 1: In order to read the CSV file we need to import the os and csv modules. Once that is done we use csv reader to read our data file. The csv reader also specifies a delimiter and variable that will be holding the contents of our CSV file.

Step 2: Looking at the information we are looking to gather we go ahead and create a python script to create functions for each of the desired calculations, sum, max and min.
